## Testing Strategy Throughout Development

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Test custom hooks and utilities
- Validate form validation logic

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Validate API integrations with mocks
- Test authentication flows

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user journeys
- Validate real API interactions
- Test performance on production-like environment

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow the established naming conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document components and functions
- Follow ESLint and Prettier rules

### State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use React Context for global UI state
- Keep local state close to components
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX

### Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Monitor bundle size and runtime performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Implement analytics for usage patterns
- Plan for regular dependency updates
- Create a process for addressing user feedback

By following this implementation plan, you'll have a structured approach to building the PrivSense React frontend application. Adjust the timeline as needed based on team size and experience.
